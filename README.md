I developed an NFT Marketplace platform designed to facilitate the trading and discovery of digital assets. The project leverages Ethereum for transaction processing and smart contract functionality, ensuring secure and transparent dealings. Utilizing technologies such as ReactJS for the frontend and ethers.js for blockchain interactions, the marketplace provides an intuitive user interface for users to create, sell, or collect NFTs. Features include wallet integration through Web3Modal, allowing users to seamlessly connect their Ethereum wallets, and IPFS integration via Pinata for decentralized file storage, ensuring that digital assets are stored securely and permanently. The platform supports essential marketplace functionalities such as listing NFTs for sale, buying NFTs, and browsing collections, all while ensuring real-time updates and interactions with the Ethereum blockchain.
